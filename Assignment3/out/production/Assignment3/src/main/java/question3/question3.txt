The files ValidateInput.java and Validate.java contain code which use regular
expressions. The regular expressions could use some improvement. For example the
validateLastName function allows last names to start with a lower case letter.
Perform the following improvements to the regular expression functions:
a) Ensure all first names are at least 3 characters long
b) Ensure all last names begin with a capital letter
c) Allow addresses to contain up to 3 words. (right now up to two are allowed)
d) Allow the state to allow up to 3 words( right now up to two are allowed)
e) The validateZip function validates 5 digit American zip codes. Modify the regular expression so
it also will validate Canadian Postal codes. (Ex// validates 54362 and A3C5K2)
f) Modify the validatePhone regular expression so it requires a 2 digit country code at the start of
the sequence (Ex 01-433-722-5324)
