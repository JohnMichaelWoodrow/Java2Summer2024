16.4 Explain why inserting additional elements into an ArrayList
object whose current size is less than its capacity is a relatively fast
operation and why inserting additional elements into an ArrayList
object whose current size is at its capacity is a relatively slow operation.


ANSWER:

Inserting elements into an ArrayList whose current size is less than its capacity is a relatively fast operation due to not needing to
resize the internal array. Capacity of the internal array is often larger than the current number of elements.

Inserting elements into an ArrayList whose current size is at its capacity is a relatively slow operation due to the internal array needing to
be resized to accommodate the new elements. The process involves multiple steps such as creating the array, copying elements and updating references
which takes up more time/resources.
