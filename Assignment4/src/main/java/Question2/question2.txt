16.5 Briefly answer the following questions:
1. What is the primary difference between a Set and a Map?
2. What happens when you add a primitive type (e.g., double)
value to a collection?
3. Can you print all the elements in a collection without using an
Iterator? If yes, how?

ANSWER:
1. A set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements, does not maintain any particular order.
A map is a collection that 'maps' keys to values does not allow duplicate keys but does allow duplicate values.

2. Collections can only store objects. Adding a primitive type will cause it to be automatically converted to the
corresponding wrapper class before being added to the collection.

3. Yes, using a for each loop or the forEach method.
